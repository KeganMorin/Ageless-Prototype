# Ageless-Prototype
Individual game project for Boise State University. VR Game Files


The Reverb Zones for this assignemnt are located by the log in the level and in the forest area at the beginning of the game as well as at the end of the game in the stone corridoor. I added a cave effect when going into the log to give it a nice echoing effect when traveling through. The forest reverb zone was added into the forest area for more immersion when the character is walking around. I added a footsteps sound effect as well for when the character walks around. The stone reverb zone was added to give more effects to the stone area at the end as well as test if I will need new sounds or new components.
